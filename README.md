## Technologies Used
Javascript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS

## Approach Taken
This a full-stack application that aims to help people who are traveling in the future plan their trip itineraries so they can stay more organized leading up to/during their travels. This app follows the MVC (Models, Views, Controllers) file structure and has a model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.

## Unsolved Problems
The show route needs some more styling. The application overall could have more features to enhance the user experience.
